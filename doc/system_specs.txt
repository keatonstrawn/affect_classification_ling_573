Data Processor (data_processor.py):

This module defines the DataProcessor class, which is used to pull and clean the raw data. The data is read in from .csv
files that are either saved locally, or downloaded from GitHub. The raw data comes from 3 separate csv files, separated
into train, validation, and test data. Each file has 5 columns: id, text, HS, TR, AG. 'id' contains the unique
identification numbers for each tweet; 'text' contains the raw text of the tweet (this includes URLs, hashtags, emojis,
references to twitter accounts, slang and misspellings, etc.); HS is a binary (0 or 1) tag that indicates whether (1) or
not (0) the tweet is classified as hate speech; TR is a binary tag that indicates whether the tweet is targeted at an
individual (1) or a general group (0); AG is a binary tag that indicates whether (1) or not (0) the tweet is aggressive.

The DataProcessor cleans the text field in the raw data. It does so by making the following changes:
1. Removing the URLs
2. Separating the hashtags from the text and storing them in a separate list
*3. Replacing slang and abbreviated terms with standard English/Spanish (if possible, need to check which resources are
    available to do this.)
4. Determining what percentage of the text is capital letters and storing that value, before lowercasing the text
5. Saving the counts of common punctuation symbols (!, ?, $, *) before removing punctuation from the text
6. Replacing '@user' references with the string 'user' and storing the original user ids in a separate list

The output will be a pandas dataframe with the following fields:
(index) id: int
cleaned_text: str
HS: binary (0, 1)
TR: binary (0, 1)
AG: binary (0, 1)
hashtags: List[str]
percent_capitals: float
exclamation_count: int
question_mark_count: int
dollar_symbol_count: int
asteriks_count: int
user_ids: List[str]
